        <p>Pelias forced Jason's father to kill himself, and as a result, his mother died of grief. Jason, however, had a trick up his sleeve: Medea. He asked Medea to kill Pelias to avenge Jason's father. Medea, of course, was happy to commit this deed. She tricked Pelias's daughters into killing him by telling them she could make him young again if they chopped him up and Medea utter a charm, and they believed her. Once they killed him, Medea vanished.</p>

        <p>There is a story that Medea taught Jason the secret of eternal youth and that Medea revived Jason's father. All Hamilton mentions of this is that it's a story. There is nothing about whether it's true or not (in the sense that the rest of the myth is true).</p>
        <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
        <p>My first question is how did Pelias force Jason's father to kill himself? Did he trick him like Medea tricked Pelias's daughters (but without magic)? Another question I had was why was Jason portreyed as a hero in the Quest of the Golden Fleece and why was he such a jerk in the myth of Jason and Medea?</p>
        <div class="quote">
          For a time Jason sat speechless. The contest seemed impossible, beyond the strength of anyone. Finally he answered, &apos;I will make this trial, monstrous though it is, even if it is my doom to die.&apos;
        </div>
        <p>He seems to be quite heroic here. Taking a closer look, my thought is that maybe he was faking the bravery to win over Medea (even though Cupid shot her with his arrow). Or maybe he changed throughout the story. Nobody can know for sure, we can only speculate.</p>

      <div id="middle">
        <p>After Medea killed Pelias, she and Jason had two sons. For a while, all was well, but Jason soon showed his true colors. He engaged the King of Corinth's daughter. Of course, Medea was hurt. She loved Jason and believed Jason loved her. The king feared Medea would harm the Princess, so he exiled her.</p>
        <p>Jason met her and said that it was her fault she was exiled. He claimed that he did his best to aid her, and the King wanted Medea killed. Jason offered Medea gold so she had everything she needed.</p>
        <div class="quote">His answer was that he had been saved not by her, but by Aphrodite, who had made her fall in love with him, and that she owed him a great deal for bringing her to Greece, a civilized country. Also that he had done very well for letting it be known how she had helped the Argonauts, so that people praised her. If only she could have had some common sense, she would have been glad of his marriage, as such a connection would have been profitable for her and the children, too. Her exile was her fault only.<br>
          Whatever else she lacked Medea had plenty of intelligence. She wasted no more words upon him except to refuse his gold. She would take nothing, no help from him. Jason flung away angrily from her. &apos;Your stubborn pride,&apos; he told her &ndash;

            But you will grieve the more for it.

        <p>Medea vowed revenge against Jason. She loved him, but he betrayed her. The way to hurt Jason the most was to kill his fianc&eacute;e. She sent her sons with a gift for the bride: a robe anointed with deadly drugs. As soon as she put it on, fire engulfed her and melted away her flesh.</p>

        <p>There was only one thing left that concerned Medea: the safety of her children. Where would they go? What would happen to them? Would they become slaves for killing the princess? One thing was certain: it wouldn't be good. The only choice Medea had was to kill her own boys.</p>
        <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
        <p>The image above shows Medea in her chariot, her dead children next to the chariot, and Jason. Jason appears furious. He is pulling out his sword and is turned towards Medea as if he is about to strike. One interesting thing about it is that Medea is pointing at the boys. It's like she is proud of what she has done. It's interesting because in Hamilton's book, Medea seems like she is worried about her children.</p>
          <div class="quote">When Medea knew the deed was done she turned her mind to one thing still more dreadful. There was no protection for her children, no help for them anywhere. A slave's life might be theirs, nothing more. &apos;I will not let them live for strangers to ill-use,&apos; she thought &ndash;
            <div class="poemQuote">
              To die by other hands more merciless than mine.<br />
              No; I who gave them life will give them death.<br />
              Oh, now no cowardice, no thought how young they are,<br />
              How dear they are, how when they first were born &ndash; <br />
              Not that &ndash; I will forget they are my sons <br />
              One moment, one short moment &ndash; then forever sorrow.
            </div>
          </div>
        <p>Read that excerpt and look back at the picture. See how it looks like she's mocking Jason? This brings the question of Medea's state of mind. Nobody knows what happens when Cupid forces someone to fall in love with someone else. Maybe it caused her to become emotionally unstable. Hamilton's book states that first she would forget they were her children, then there would forever be sorrow. Does she mean sorrow for Jason or sorrow for herself? If she means sorrow for Jason, the picture seems to agree with it. However, if she means sorrow for herself, the picture contradicts it.</p>
